# BridgeGuard Security Testing Framework

A comprehensive security testing suite designed to validate cross-chain bridge security against known exploits and vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Tests Overview

Based on analysis of major bridge exploits including:
- **Ronin Bridge** - $624M (Private key compromise)
- **Wormhole Bridge** - $326M (Signature verification bypass)
- **Poly Network** - $611M (Privileged contract exploit)
- **Nomad Bridge** - $190M (Merkle tree validation failure)

## üìã Test Categories

### 1. Signature Security Tests
**Critical for preventing the most common bridge exploits**

- **Signature Validation**: Tests cryptographic signature format and validity
- **Replay Attack Protection**: Validates unique keys and nonce mechanisms
- **Signature Malleability**: Tests resistance to signature format manipulation
- **Cross-Chain Replay**: Ensures chain ID separation prevents cross-chain replays

### 2. DoS Protection Tests
**Prevents resource exhaustion and availability attacks**

- **Rate Limiting**: Tests 20 requests/10sec limit enforcement
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Validates payload size limits and memory protection
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Tests system stability under load

### 3. Access Control Tests
**Validates authorization and privilege boundaries**

- **Unauthorized Access**: Tests signature-based authentication
- **Privilege Escalation**: Validates admin endpoint protection
- **Wallet Address Validation**: Tests address format and ownership verification

### 4. Bridge-Specific Exploit Tests
**Tests against bridge-specific vulnerabilities**

- **Double Spending**: Validates transaction uniqueness and deduplication
- **Invalid Token Manipulation**: Tests token validation and whitelist enforcement
- **Amount Validation**: Tests numerical limits and overflow protection
- **Destination Address Validation**: Tests recipient address format validation

## üöÄ Running Security Tests

### Quick Demo (No Wallet Required)
```bash
node src/security-demo.js
```

### Public API Tests
```bash
npm run public-test
```

### Full Security Audit
```bash
npm run security
```

### Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Signature security only
node -e "import('./src/security-tester.js').then(m => new m.BridgeSecurityTester(client).testSignatureValidation())"
```

## üìä Security Assessment Levels

### ‚úÖ PASS (Green) - Production Ready
- All security tests passed
- No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities
- Bridge is secure against known exploits

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN (Yellow) - Review Required  
- Some non-critical issues found
- Medium severity vulnerabilities present
- Safe for testing, review before production

### üö® FAIL (Red) - Critical Issues
- High or critical severity vulnerabilities detected
- **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**
- Immediate remediation required

## üîç Common Vulnerabilities Detected

### Critical Issues
1. **Deterministic Signatures** - Replay attacks possible
2. **Missing Chain ID** - Cross-chain replay vulnerability
3. **No Rate Limiting** - DoS attack vector
4. **Invalid Token Acceptance** - Token validation bypass
5. **Double Spending** - Transaction replay possible

### Medium Issues
1. **Signature Malleability** - Format manipulation possible
2. **Large Payload Acceptance** - Resource exhaustion risk
3. **Insufficient Error Handling** - Information leakage

### Low Issues
1. **Verbose Error Messages** - Information disclosure
2. **Missing Request Logging** - Audit trail gaps

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Recommendations

### For Bridge Developers
1. **Implement Unique Nonces**: Every request must have a unique identifier
2. **Add Chain ID to Signatures**: Prevent cross-chain replay attacks
3. **Enforce Rate Limits**: Implement 20 requests/10sec global limit
4. **Validate All Inputs**: Reject invalid tokens, addresses, and amounts
5. **Use Time-based Nonces**: Prevent signature replay across time
6. **Implement Multi-sig**: Require multiple signatures for high-value transactions

### For Bridge Operators
1. **Regular Security Testing**: Run security tests after every update
2. **Monitor Transaction Patterns**: Watch for unusual activity
3. **Implement Circuit Breakers**: Auto-pause on suspicious activity
4. **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate signing keys periodically
5. **Professional Security Audits**: Third-party reviews for critical bridges

## üìà Security Testing Metrics

### Test Coverage
- **9 Security Test Categories**
- **50+ Individual Test Cases**
- **Historical Exploit Scenarios**: Tests based on real-world attacks
- **Edge Case Testing**: Invalid inputs, boundary conditions

### Performance Impact
- **Test Duration**: ~30-60 seconds full suite
- **Network Impact**: Minimal, mostly local validation
- **Resource Usage**: Low CPU/memory footprint
- **API Rate Limiting**: Respects bridge rate limits

## üîí Best Practices for Bridge Security

### Development Phase
1. **Security-First Design**: Build security tests before implementation
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Reject by default, allow by exception
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs rigorously
4. **Error Handling**: Never expose internal system details

### Testing Phase  
1. **Automated Testing**: Integrate security tests in CI/CD
2. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual security reviews
3. **Penetration Testing**: Simulate real attack scenarios
4. **Load Testing**: Test under high transaction volumes

### Production Phase
1. **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
2. **Incident Response**: Plan for security incidents
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodic security assessments
4. **Update Management**: Keep all components updated

## ‚ö° Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Security Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run security
      - name: Fail on critical vulnerabilities
        run: exit ${{ steps.security.outputs.exit_code }}
```

## üìû Support and Reporting
